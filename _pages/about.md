Hi! I'm Lena, a PhD student at chair of information systems at the University of Regensburg in GÃ¼nther Pernul's group. My Phd topic is about exploring the potential of cyber ranges, replications of real systems, as way to train individuals to detect and mitigate cyber attacks. I'm also interested in other aspect of human and organization-centric cybersecurity.
