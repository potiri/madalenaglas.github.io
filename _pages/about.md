Hi! I'm Lena, a PhD student at (chair of information systems (Prof. Dr. GÃ¼nther Pernul))[https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatik-data-science/wi-pernul/startseite/index.html] at the University of Regensburg. My research evolves about human-centric aspects of security and privacy. 

My PhD topic, in particular, is about exploring the potential of cyber ranges, replications of real systems, as a way to train individuals to detect and mitigate cyber attacks. 

During my PhD I was involved in the INSIST project, funded by the Bavarian StMWi, about securing the Industrial Internet of Things by buidling an Industrial Security Operations Center.

You can find news about our group and my research on our (lab website)[https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatik-data-science/wi-pernul/new-s/index.html].
