Hi! I'm Lena, a PhD student at chair of information systems at the University of Regensburg in GÃ¼nther Pernul's group. My research evolves about human-centric aspects of cybersecurity. 

My PhD topic, in particular, is about exploring the potential of cyber ranges, replications of real systems, as way to train individuals to detect and mitigate cyber attacks. 

During my PhD I was involved in the INSIST project, funded by the Bavarian StMWi, about securing the Industrial Internet of Things by buidling an Industrial Security Operations Center.
